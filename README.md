# Rock-Vs-Mine
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project to classify SONAR signals as either rock or mine using Python. The dataset consists of sonar signals reflected off metal cylinders (mines) and rocks. The goal is to build a robust classification model to distinguish between these two classes.

Key Features:
✔ Data preprocessing and feature engineering
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Model training using various algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
✔ Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization
✔ Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
✔ Deployment-ready script for predictions

Dataset
The dataset is publicly available and contains 208 samples with 60 continuous features representing sonar signal frequencies.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
