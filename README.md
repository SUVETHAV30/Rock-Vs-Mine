# Rock-Vs-Mine
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project to classify SONAR signals as either rock or mine using Python. The dataset consists of sonar signals reflected off metal cylinders (mines) and rocks. The goal is to build a robust classification model to distinguish between these two classes.
